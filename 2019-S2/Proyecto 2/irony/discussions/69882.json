    "Html": "<p>Thanks for your feedback!</p>\r\n<p>As for SyntaxEditor - not so sure... the problem is - it is propriatary control sold for price. Even if I do the integration (just as a test), I won't be able to use it in GrammarExplorer, or share it in general with other folks - running&nbsp;integrated solution&nbsp;would require having this control installed. On the other hand, seems like a good&nbsp;suggestion for ActiPro folks - to implement integration of their control with an open source solution...&nbsp; I've seen suggestions&nbsp; on their forums to look at integration with Irony - maybe they'll get to it</p>\r\n<p>Roman&nbsp;</p>",
