I have a limited set of &quot;variables&quot; (x, y, etc) so I have them defined as NonTerminal; but if I add X and Y, then x and y won't be parsed correctly. Is there a simple way to set a flag somewhere to make the parses case insensitive or do I have to ToLower everything before passing it to Irony?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance,\r<br />\nFlorinator<br />\n",
