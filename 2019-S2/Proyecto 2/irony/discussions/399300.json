    "Html": "<p>sorry man, but have no time for debugging such monsters. Can only give you an advice - load grammar in Grammar explorer! It does not matter what happens with this trouble line - it might be just the last straw that breaks the camel's back. Load it, look at errors, conflicts, state map etc. Pretty damn sure there are a lot of conflicts. Work with them, cleanup the grammar. I would suggest initially trim the grammar, use some simpler version, and gradually add stuff while removing conflicts. For the troubled line - enable it and step into parser data builder, see if it drops into infinite loop somewhere. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>One question - what's the purpose of this? Roslyn IS a parser for c#, so why do another one?!</p>\r\n<p>Roman</p>",
