I have tried raising the precedence of the dataitem over the identifier. I have also tried inheriting an IdetifierTerminal into my own custom DataItemTerminal and also removing\r\n the identifier terminal in the OnScannerSelectTerminal override. If the latter, is there a sample for this since when I have tried to do this, I am getting a nullreferenceexception in GetUnfilteredTokens and I am struggling to work out what I am failing to\r\n configure properly to get my own terminal to dovetail into the mechanism.</p>\r\n<p>What is the right way to do this with Irony?</p>\r\n<p>Further, if I would identify the string M1E1I1Hello as an identifier rather than as a dataitem followed by an identifier, is that possible or would I need to included delimiters as in</p>\r\n<p>Dim dataitemExpression = New NonTerminal(&quot;dataitemExpression&quot;, GetType(DataItemExpressionNode))</p>\r\n<p>dataitemExpression.Rule = &quot;[&quot; &#43; dataitem &#43; &quot;]&quot;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Many thanks in advance</p>\r\n<p>Simon</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
