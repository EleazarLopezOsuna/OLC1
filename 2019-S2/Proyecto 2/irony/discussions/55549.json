Read my blog, read articles (links on project home page), go thru the code - it is not too hard to get the idea of project architecture directly from code. Contribution - welcome, especially if you're from research field - research in computer science/compilers? Many open areas, lots of things to do, especially for someone with theoretical expertise. <br>\r\nRoman \r\n",
