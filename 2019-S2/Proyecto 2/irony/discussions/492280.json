I want to know, if it is possible to parse only a specific block of a code\\text file and ignoring the rest, so that I do not have to define the grammer for the &quot;rest&quot;.\r<br />\n<br />\nExample text file content:\r<br />\n<br />\nsome text that I am not interesting in \r<br />\nmore text... more words...\r<br />\nsome code that I am not interesting in\r<br />\n<br />\nDEF VAR a int = 10;\r<br />\nDEF VAR b int = 20;\r<br />\n<br />\nsome text... many words...\r<br />\nmore text... more words...\r<br />\nsome code...\r<br />\n \r<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe question is now, how can I build a grammar\\parser that ignores all text except the &quot;DEF VAR...&quot; lines?\r<br />\nI alread have defined a grammar for the &quot;DEF VAR...&quot; lines, but when I am parsing the files I logically get parsing errors.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance!<br />\n",
