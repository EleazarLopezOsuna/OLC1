I experimented with the ExpressionEvaluatorGrammar and noted that it was not able to solve expressions of the type true==false. Giving me an error. I found this strange because &amp;&amp; and || operators do work without problem. <br />\nI broke the cause of the error down to some missing lines in <br />\n<pre><code>LanguageRuntime.InitBinaryOperatorImplementationsForMatchedTypes</code></pre>\n\nI just added the following lines in the appropriate sections and everything works fine now.<br />\n<pre><code>      AddBinary(op, typeof(bool), (x, y) =&gt; checked((bool)x == (bool)y), BoolResultConverter);\n      AddBinary(op, typeof(bool), (x, y) =&gt; checked((bool)x != (bool)y), BoolResultConverter);\n</code></pre>\n\nIs there a specific reason, why those lines where not part from the beginning?<br />\n<br />\nBest regards<br />\nMarwie<br />\n",
