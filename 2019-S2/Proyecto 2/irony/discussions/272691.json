    "Html": "<p>It can work either way; I assume you are not parsing only, but executing it as well? Then it depends on execution semantics, which way is more logical. Do you have \"IS\" operator outside of this case? See then if you could put NULL-comparison semantics into this. For parsing, these differences should not matter much, it will result only in different naming of non-terminals but essentially the grammar structure will be the same.&nbsp;</p>",

Here you have an oportunity to differentiate your language giving meaning\r\n and good use to &quot;NOT NULL&quot;... I can't think of an example, and that's the point, make a language that makes me think different... or else, why don't you use an existing one?* Otherwise just drop the &quot;like&quot; of &quot;sql-like&quot;, it is an sql dialect, stand by that\r\n and be proud of it.\r\n<div><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>So for the check &quot;IS NOT&quot; will be the way to go, unless you have a good use for &quot;NOT NULL&quot; in other places and you have no trouble making a negation of the comparison to other things (you only use IS for NULL, or you are ok to make NULL the special boy\r\n that doesn't require &quot;NOT (something IS NULL)&quot; or similar).</div>\r\n<div><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>I don't know the language you are making or how it will be used, so don't take this as the last word, just consider it.
