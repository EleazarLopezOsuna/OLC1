    "Html": "<p>This reminds me of an earlier <a href=\"http://irony.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=70460\">discussion thread</a> with Roman where I recommended the addition to Irony's parser the ability to NOT allow white-space between two terminals.  He found it to be an interesting suggestion and said that it would be done using a Grammar Hint, such as NoWhiteSpace(), and syntax sugar could be added to short hand it with something like the & character.  It's probably low on his list and I haven't had time to attempt the change.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Anyhow, as Irony lays now, I think your best bet would be to create a custom terminal that lays emphasis on the special CSS characters ( [ . # ) and white-space.  Unfortunately I don't think this would be a fun custom terminal to code, but I could be wrong.</p>\r\n<br><br>\r\n-MindCore",

    "Html": "<p>ye, that's true, we've already discussed the no-whitespace option, and it is still on my to-do list. But for this case, I don't see how whitespace is relevant. Your BNF expression does not indicate that spaces are involved at all. Can you please elaborate on this? I suspect you have different kind of problem.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>General note - don't use Plus() and Star() methods, they are obsolete, I will remove them soon; use MakePlusRule and MakeStarRule instead.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
