I am trying to create grammar for sql with good error handling.\r<br />\nThe question is how to leave last terminal in error rule in stack?\r<br />\n<br />\nFor example, i have next sql statement:\r<br />\n<br />\nselect a,b bAlias errorSymbol,c from table\r<br />\n<br />\nI have errorRule for column: SyntaxError+&quot;,&quot;\r<br />\n<br />\nSo, when parsing sample statement, parser recovers error, but when recovering it &quot;eats&quot; &quot;,&quot;.\r<br />\nHow can i leave &quot;,&quot; on stack so after recovering it starts from it?<br />\n",
