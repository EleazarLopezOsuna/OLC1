    "Html": "<p>Hi</p>\r\n<p>Michael (the author) consulted me when preparing the article, and this problem surfaced at the time. The reason is the limitation of SQL server query syntax - it does not allow NOT in front of the query. Here is an extract from&nbsp; his email:</p>\r\n<p><em>...the&nbsp;issue is the - at the beginning of a phrase.&nbsp; Like this:<br>\r\n-&quot;Fish and chips&quot;<br>\r\nConverts to:<br>\r\nNOT “Fish and chips”<br>\r\nWhich is an illegal construct in SQL Server.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</em>In the end, he had to disallow leading minus in input grammar. This is one of the differences with Google syntax, he probably forgot to mention it in his article. You should contact the author directly I think, or post question with the article<br>\r\nRoman</p>\r\n",
