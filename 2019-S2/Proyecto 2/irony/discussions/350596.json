I assume this is because the parser is looking at the initial 'pd' as a single token and it is not mathing any rule, or something like that. The problem goes away if I insert spaces between adjacent letters, but that\r\n is not something I want to require.\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Is there a way to override this behavior so that the parser will consider each letter individually, and not as a whole word? This is not a problem with the non-letter symbols.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
