I'm using Visual Studio 2008 with SilverLight 3 and the Irony 51617 DLL.</p>\r\n<p>In trying to duplicate the following segment of D. Flowers' tutorial code:</p>\r\n<pre id=pre9 lang=cs>MyGrammar grammar = <span>new</span> MyGrammar();\r\nLanguageCompiler compiler = <span>new</span> LanguageCompiler(grammar);\r\nAstNode program = compiler.Parse(source_code);</pre>\r\n<p>I've run into an obstacle: I can't find LanguageCompiler. Has it been replaced? Or am I missing a reference?</p>\r\n<p>2. I haven't found much online help in getting started with Irony, and none at all with code examples that work with the latest version. I hope I'm missing something. Do you guys have any advice, references, or resources that I could use?</p>\r\n<p>3. I'm interested in creating a&nbsp;validation program for owl 2 manchester syntax (<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/NOTE-owl2-manchester-syntax-20091027/\">http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/NOTE-owl2-manchester-syntax-20091027/</a>) using Irony.&nbsp;If anyone has any experience/knowledge in this area, I would much appreciate your assistance (in the form of&nbsp;advice, references, or resources).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
