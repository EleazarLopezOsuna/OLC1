    "Html": "<p>Thanks. &nbsp;From the looks of the DLR project, it does seem to be a very complex version of what you're already providing. &nbsp;It probably just depends on the design, complexity, and features of the language you're building as to whether you go with the DLR or the built-in runtime in Irony. &nbsp;I could see someone starting off with the built-in runtime and then moving to the DLR, especially if they're wanting to provide a debug experience.</p>\r\n<p>I'm going mess around with it and see just how difficult it would be to use. &nbsp;The IronLua project is a good example. &nbsp;You should probably make reference to it on the home page or maybe I'll put a section in the wikibook.</p>",
