As for the latter, the answer is definitely yes, I don't see why you can't implement PHP grammar in Irony; you can try it even without Mono</p>\r\n<p>As for Mono, I would like to know it myself. Definitely it is possible to port Irony to Mono, the question is just how many changes will be needed. I suspect that Runtime classes cannot be ported yet, they use lambda expressions which come in .NET 3.5, and Mono is not there yet, as far as I know. As for the rest, it should be portable without big problems. Try it and let everybody know the results, maybe share some code. On my side, I'll try to provide all help I can</p>\r\n<p>Roman</p>",
