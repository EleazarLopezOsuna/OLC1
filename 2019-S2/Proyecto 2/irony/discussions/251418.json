I was kinda hoping that one of you guys, with vested interest can help with the effort for particular servers. Vested interest, I mean - with need for a decent ORM and having non-MS-SQL database as platform.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Otherwise, I don't see how this might happen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>thanks for your kind words and friendly feedback!</p>\r\n<p>Roman</p>",
