How does Irony handle context-sensitive tex? For example, in order to do this in ANTLR code needs to be injected to keep\r\n track of the state. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:'Segoe UI','sans-serif'; color:black; font-size:10pt\">Another question I have is, how easy is it to call another parser during a parsing session. This is necessary when you have a mix of 2 or more languages ex) C# embedded in XML.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:'Segoe UI','sans-serif'; color:black; font-size:10pt\">Thank you!</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

For example, NonTerminal has Reduced event which is fired when the rule is recognized and reduced. You can handle this event and do your custom stuff.</p>\r\n<p>As for #2 - mixing grammars. Directly and automatically it's not supported. But it is doable I think. Let's say you have a mix of HTML with JavaScript snippets inside closing tag. Something like this.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Parsing 'combined' languages is an interesting feature, may be we'll get to support it in more direct way.</p>\r\n<p>Roman</p>\r\n",
