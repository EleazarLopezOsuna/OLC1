KeyTerms appear to work properly because I can grab the actual KeyTerm that I want from the grammar and everyone is happy. \r<br />\n<br />\nWhat doesn't work is if I have an IdentifierTerminal named &quot;Term&quot;. If I want to add a new &quot;Term&quot; in my TokenFilter I can't just create a new IdentifierTerminal in the BeginFiltering method because the state machine in the parser only knows about the &quot;Term&quot; that was created in my grammar definition.\r<br />\n<br />\nAny new &quot;Term&quot; that I create won't cause a hit in the currState.Actions hashmap. Am I attempting to do something that is not allowed, or is there a legitimate way to create new tokens like this in a TokenFilter that won't cause the state machine to stop?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks for any help.<br />\n",
