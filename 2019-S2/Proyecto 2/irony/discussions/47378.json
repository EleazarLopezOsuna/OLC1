One of problems is that project is still evolving, so any documents can quickly fall out of date. Your question about WHERE clause. Remember, grammar definition is in c#, so it should be valid c# statement. In this context, what is the meaning of WHERE thing in your proposed version?<br>\r\nAddKeywords - currently is kinda broken. See thread about language service for some more explanation,will fix it soon. <br>\r\nRoman\r\n",
