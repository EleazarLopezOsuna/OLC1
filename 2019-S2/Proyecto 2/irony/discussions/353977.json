I added support for LIMIT and OFFSET in the select statement. However, the LIMIT option and OFFSET option can appear before GROUP BY or after GROUP BY.</p>\r\n<p>Currently I have the following rule, which reports &quot;Shift-reduce conflict&quot; error.</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>selectStmt.Rule = SELECT &#43; columnItemList &#43; FROM &#43; fromItem &#43; whereClauseOpt &#43;\r\n                              limitOpt &#43; offsetOpt &#43;\r\n                              groupClauseOpt &#43; havingClauseOpt &#43; orderClauseOpt &#43;\r\n                              limitOpt &#43; offsetOpt;\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>As you can see, my rule has limitOpt and offsetOpt twice, which would be the cause of compilation error.</p>\r\n<p>How should I fix this error?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>\r\n",
