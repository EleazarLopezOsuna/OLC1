The author references an Irony language service templet for use with VS2008. There is a download in that article for a template to generate a Visual Studio Integration Package for an Irony Language Service.\r<br />\n<br />\nIt seems like this would be a very useful addition to Irony. We looked at the latest Irony download, but didn't find anything at all related to VS extensions.\r<br />\n<br />\nDoes anyone know where, or if, there's an update to such a template?\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards,<br />\n<pre><code>- Steve Nunez\n</code></pre>\n\n",
