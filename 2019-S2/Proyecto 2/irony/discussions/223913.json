I was able to adopt the Language template from VS2008 to VS2010. After some small modifications I was able to compile it. The Grammar explorer is working well.</p>\r\n<p>Then I tried to start a new VS2010 Hive with the Language Service. But I wasn't successful.</p>\r\n<p>VS2010 comes up but no code highlighting / checks / completions at all.</p>\r\n<p>I think this is an issue while using target framework .NET 3.5!?</p>\r\n<p>I tried to change it to 4.0, changed some reference libs - but no luck getting it work. (No compile errors, but the Grammar Explorer blames about System.BadImageFormatException)...</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Anyway - is there a Irony lib available for VS2010? Was anybody successful getting it run with VS2010 Hive?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>wonder123</p>",
