I have an unary operator (the only unary operator in the grammar) that is defined like so: <br><br>var notOp = new NonTerminal(&quot;not operator&quot;);<br> notOp.Rule = ToTerm(&quot;not&quot;); <br><br>But if I try to parse the text &quot;not&quot;... the 'not' gets recognized as an 'identifier'! I've spent hours trying to fix this. Any ideas? I'd be happy to post my whole grammar here if it helps.",
