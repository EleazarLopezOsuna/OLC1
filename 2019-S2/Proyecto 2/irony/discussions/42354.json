    "Html": "I'm afraid that's not possible already, or it might be quite difficult. .NET 3.5 features are too much involved already, especially in LanguageRuntime classes. You can try to cut out manually all dependencies on 3.5. Just start with source code, reference .NET 2.0; disable LanguageRuntimeInit class - it has a lot of lambda expressions.Â For FullTextSearch, you don't need runtime anyway. Just either remove use of LanguageRuntime, or clean-up the class from .NET 3.5 stuff. Just try to fix all compiler errors. Hopefullly it will work once you can compile it.<br>\r\nAnother trouble may be with the Hashset&lt;T&gt; class, not sure if it is there in .NET 2.0. <br>\r\nGood luck<br>\r\n",
