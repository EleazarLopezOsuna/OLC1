I'm at the point where I have the majority of the grammar implemented and can walk the tree to extract information I need.  My problem now is handling the cases where * is used in the column list.  I have no problems with just select * from table, but rather select table.* from table inner join table2 on table.id = table2.id.\r<br />\n<br />\nI'm looking for suggestions on how to implement within the grammar to handle * in the column list with a table name or alias, but only allow it to be used 1 time consecutively.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks!<br />\n",
