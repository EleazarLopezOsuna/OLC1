The StringSet class is a specialization HashSet&lt;string&gt; of generic template Hashset, which has this troubled HostProtection attribute on it. This effectively prohibits it from using in safe assemblies in server environment. The StringSet is too deeply used in Irony to try to replace it with something. It is really frustrating to see such a general purpose &quot;innocent&quot; class to bear an indicator of possibility of such a host-hostile behavior. <br>\r\nThe only thing I can suggest is to try to<strong> load Irony as unsafe assembly.</strong> In this case SQL Server bypasses all these programmatic checks. According to documentation it is SQL Server admin's choice to rely on his own judgement about assembly and tell SQL to trust it. Irony doesn't do any dangerous tricks with unmanaged code and system APIs, so probably it won't harm server in any way.
