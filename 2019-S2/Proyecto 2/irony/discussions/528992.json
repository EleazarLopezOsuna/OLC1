Do you know if there is something like Irony in Java/Android? or better yet, is there an Irony port to Java/Android? I have even considered porting it myself but I think it would be a little naive to step on it without asking first an opinion on this.\r<br />\n<br />\nregards<br />\n",

For that we will use natively ANTLR.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks everyone for the tips. And yes, I will continue using Irony nevertheless for the server solution.<br />\n",
