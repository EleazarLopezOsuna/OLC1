    "Html": "<p>it is in fact not doable at parsing stage. You should differentiate between syntax analysis - what can be derived from pure phrase structure; and semantics - what follows from language rules and meaning it gives to certain constructs. In your case, &quot;a:=b&quot; would be in fact in most languages interpreted as assignment of &quot;ref to b-function&quot; to variable &quot;a&quot;, not a call to function &quot;b()&quot; and assignment of result to a; while expression like &quot;a = b()&quot; is usually interpreted as a function call. So you parse all these a's and b's as identifiers, build a parse tree/AST tree, and then at the phase of analysis (scanning AST tree) you derive more information - that &quot;b&quot; is in fact ref to function, a is a variable, etc</p>\r\n<p>You can find more on this in compiler/parsing textbooks, or even in wikipedia entries for syntax analysis and symantic analysis.</p>\r\n<p>Roman</p>",
