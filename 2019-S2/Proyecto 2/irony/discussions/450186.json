It uses the delimiters property at the end<br />\n<pre><code>this.Delimiters = &quot;{}[](),:;+-*/%&amp;|^!~&lt;&gt;=&quot;;</code></pre>\n\nWhen i tried to use the same in my Grammar adding &quot;\\&quot; it did not work. I then looked at the Grammar base class and it does not look to be using the property. It has a function &quot;IsWhitespaceOrDelimiter&quot; that is possible to override, but it does not use the Delimiter property.\r<br />\n<br />\nShould the Delimiter property be removed or is it a bug in the IsWhitespaceOrDelimiter?<br />\n",
