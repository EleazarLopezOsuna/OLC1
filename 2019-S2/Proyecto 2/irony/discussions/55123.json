Certainly, the blog is not a replacement for a real documentation and user or programmer guides - this will come eventually. The main trouble with documentation is that it does not make much sense to document things that continue to change - and at least until now - April 2009 - the Irony code and public API-s were quite unstable and changing all the time. Now it looks like things get settled and pretty soon I will start thinking about documenting it. This future documentation will eventually explain how to use it and how it works to some extent. This blog on the other hand will be providing some background explanations why things were done in a certain way. </p>\r\nThe first post is about April code update - improvements and changes. Enjoy it!<br>\r\n",
