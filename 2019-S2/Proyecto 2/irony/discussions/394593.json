So I just describe my problem, maybe any of you guys had a similar problem and can point me in the right direction or give\r\n me some hint.</p>\r\n<p>Consider the following lines of code:</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>var0 = not var1 &#43; var2\nvar0 = not (var1 &#43; var2)\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&quot;not&quot; has highest precedence, &quot;&#43;&quot; a much lower one. The point is, the first line works. It results in &quot;var0 = (not var1) &#43; var2&quot;, which is correct. The second line, however, leads to a parsing error at the plus-operator. If I change the precedence of &quot;not&quot;\r\n to be lower than that of &quot;&#43;&quot;, parsing works fine, but clearly expressions without braces would then be parsed incorrectly due to the wrong operator precedence.</p>\r\n<p>It seems that at the plus operator, the parser checks the precedence, and as &quot;not&quot; has higher precedence than &quot;&#43;&quot;, it reduces var1, which is not correct because there is an opening brace beforehand.</p>\r\n<p>I am thankful for any hint!<br>\r\nRegards,<br>\r\nMarkus</p>\r\n",
