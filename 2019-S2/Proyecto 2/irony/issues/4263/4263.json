      "Message": "I know, I noticed it before, the grammar is crap, intended to be just a demo. I tweaked the original version from spec a lot, and not sure if it is error in original (there are quite a few there for sure), or result of my tweaking. \r\nAnyhow, I would welcome some help with this. Can you (or somebody else?) start c# grammar from scratch and translate one-to-one the spec grammar, including LINQ stuff? Would really appreciate the help. I'm planning to use this grammar as a test pad for non-canonical parsing algorithm, that supposed to be much better at conflict resolution.\r\nthanks\r\nRoman\r\n",
