    "Description": "Hello All,\r\n  I am implementing a language in Irony similar (for now) to C#. It was implemented from the C# 4.0 specification. It has issues when parsing method declarations. Specifically, it is failing to reduce to __return_type__. I have tested changing the __return_type__ in __method_header__ to __type_ref__ and it then recognizes the declaration, but it fails for a __void__ return type (for obvious reasons). I feel I am missing something and could use some other eyes on this. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n  I have attached the complete grammar. and the important bits are detailed below.\r\n\r\n// NonTerminals\r\ntype_ref, return_type, method_header, method_declaration\r\n\r\n__KeyTerm__ @void = ToTerm( \"void\" );\r\ntype_ref.Rule = value_type | reference_type | type_parameter;\r\nreturn_type.Rule = type_ref | @void;\r\n\r\nmethod_header.Rule = member_header + return_type + member_name + type_parameter_list.Q() + open_par + formal_parameter_list.Q() + close_par + type_parameter_constraints_clauses.Q();\r\nmethod_declaration.Rule = method_header + method_body;\r\n",
