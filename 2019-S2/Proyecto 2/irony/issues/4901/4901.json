    "Description": "When evaluating unary operators the second argument in the context should be set to null.\n\nI declared a call dispatcher for a unary operator \"not\" just for booleans and I kept getting that it was not defined for System.String because there was a reminder string in the second argument from the context from the previous evaluation.",
