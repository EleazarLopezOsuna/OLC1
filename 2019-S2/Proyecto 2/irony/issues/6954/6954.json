    "Description": "Hi Roman, \n\nFirst thanks for releasing this great work. I am having trouble to open and compile the solution. VS2008 is complaining about source control binding and most projects loaded with the unavailable status. I have tried to unbind the source control but still no luck. (This may not be the reason, but I am using 64bit Windows 7 environment.) Is there a way you can release the source code not biding to source control? Thanks\n\nDuncan",
