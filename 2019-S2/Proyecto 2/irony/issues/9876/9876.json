    "Description": "Hi, \r\n\r\nI am using the irony package for visual studio integration of my language. I am storing all the declarations in one container and then when i do \"ctrl+ spacebar\" for auto completion options i have list of variables declared already. Now the problem is whenever i delete some lines of declaration i need to remove those entries from the declaration data container. For that i am thinking in two ways \r\n\r\n1. handling a delete event or\r\n\r\n2. reparsing the contents whenever the auto completion is initiated.\r\n\r\nIn the 1st method i don't know is there any provision to provide event handlers for keyboard inputs. If there's a way and it is a right way then please guide me.\r\n\r\nIn the second method i don't know how to reparse the contents for the current language service instance.\r\n\r\nAny help will be greatly helpful.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n",
