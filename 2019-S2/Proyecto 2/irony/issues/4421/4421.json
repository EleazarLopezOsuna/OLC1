    "Description": "For some list nodes (I am not sure I can reproduce this reliably) AstNodeCreator is called when there is only a single ChildNode.\nI suppose this is related to code in CodeParser.ExecuteReduce, which adds children to the node (alreadyCreatedList) after AstNodeCreator was already called.\n\nI think the fix would be to postpone AstNodeCreator until there are no more child nodes.",
