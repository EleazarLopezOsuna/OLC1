    "Description": "Hello...I was getting this error when trying to use Irony inside a solution that had a key generated for another project.  Apparently, if you try to mix key-signed with not signed assemblies you get this.  \n\nI generated a key for Irony on my local copy and it was fixed but you might want to generate a key for Irony and check it into the subversion.",
