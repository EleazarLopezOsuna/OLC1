It won't locate the dependencies in the GAC,\nbut it will locate them within the same folder as your grammar assembly.\n\nI'd suggest that AutoRefresh option changes assembly loading method.\nAutoRefresh is disabled -> assembly is loaded via LoadFrom(fileName) and is locked.\nAutoRefresh is enabled -> assembly is loaded as a byte array and isn't locked.\nThis way the user will have an option to use the standard (more reliable) assembly probing algorithm.\nBut checking/unchecking AutoRefresh checkbox will require restarting GrammarExplorer (to release locked files).",
