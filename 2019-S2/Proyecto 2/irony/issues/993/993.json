    "Description": "Hi Roman\n\nGreat tool.  I'm reporting a small bug here.  The problem is in scanner.cs with the while loop on line 87.  If you use the Expression Grammar and enter the expression:\n\n1 + !\n\nScanner gets stuck in the loop because the invalid exclamation mark is not found.  Extending the while condition to test _source.EOF() as well fixes the issue.\n\nBill Seddon",
